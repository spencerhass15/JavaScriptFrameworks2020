## Getting Started

You will need to have two terminal windows open and running at once. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can click on the split-screen or plus icon in your terminal panel:

In one terminal window, you will need to run the authentication server. Please follow the steps [in this README.md](../../resources/authentication-server/README.md) on how to install and start the authentication server.

In the other terminal window, you will need to navigate to the this folder, install all dependencies, and start this example.

```bash
cd examples/11a-authentication-local-storage/
yarn install
yarn start
```
