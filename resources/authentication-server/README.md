In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Server Installation

Using your command line, you will need to navigate to the resources folder, install all dependencies, and start the server by typing in the commands down below.

```bash
cd resources/authentication-server/
yarn install
yarn start
```

After running the server on your machine, you will be greeted with a message Your server is running on http://localhost:7000 .

## Making AJAX Requests

The API is a REST based API. You must use Axios or FETCH with stand-alone promises or async and await.

| Route                               | METHOD | Response                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | :----: | ---------------------------------------------- |
| http://localhost:7000/jwt/login     |  POST  | Status 200 (Success) Status 401 (Unauthorized) |
| http://localhost:7000/cookie/login  |  POST  | Status 200 (Success) Status 401 (Unauthorized) |
| http://localhost:7000/jwt/movies    |  GET   | Status 200 (Success) Status 403 (Forbidden)    |
| http://localhost:7000/cookie/movies |  GET   | Status 200 (Success) Status 403 (Forbidden)    |

For the login APIs, the following user account will work:

Username: username
Password: password
